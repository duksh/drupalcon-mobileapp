That\u0027s right: write a few lines of English and suddenly you can watch as Selenium (or some other tool) opens up a browser and makes requests, clicks links and fills out forms on your application!\r\n\r\nBut Behat is more than that:\u0026nbsp;it let\u0027s you think about the\u0026nbsp;behavior\u0026nbsp;of your features first,\u0026nbsp;before\u0026nbsp;you\u0026nbsp;start to develop. In this talk, we\u0027ll learn about behavior-driven development and learn enough about Behat to get you started immediately with your project.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, we\u0027ll master Mink - the partner library to Behat - and solve all sorts of common testing problems. Oh, and thanks to the Drupal community, we\u0027ll see how the DrupalExtension - the Drupal plugin for Behat - can make it possible to control the data (e.g. nodes, users, etc) before you start each test.\r\n"},{"id":"10","title":"How To Grow Support To Become A Cornerstone Of Your Business","date":"2016-05-11 00:00:00","room":"5","startTime":"10:45","endTime":"11:45","track":"1","experiencelevel":"beginner","desc":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we started our support program, it almost seemed like post-launch support was a dirty word in the community. \u0026nbsp;It was very easy to build a fancy Drupal site and walk away. \u0026nbsp;We noticed that the average end user can\u0027t really work a Drupal site that well.

Drupal just started into its 8 cycle and the world is not standing still.\r\n\r\nHowever even with all the new technologies of PHP 7, dynamic page cache, BigPipe, Placeholders, etc.\u0026nbsp;Drupal 8 still has a quite\u0026nbsp;slow bootstrap phase, the internal page cache could be faster and a lot of time is wasted while waiting for I\/O (Files, Database, APC, memcache, http requests, ...) and rebuilding of caches.\r\n\r\nPHP is ready! Are you?\r\n\r\nLets explore together in this core conversation how the future of Drupal performance could look and what we need to change internally to ensure we get back on par to fast-response systems like NodeJS.\r\n\r\nOne such thing that Drupal could start doing is to start using a parallelized approach. While Drupal\u0026nbsp;is waiting, it could do other CPU intensive tasks until those are blocked again on I\/O, then get back to the original task, etc.\r\n\r\nFor this we need a kind of\u0026nbsp;event loop and a different structure within Drupal. But PHP is ready: Technologies like ReactPHP, icicle.io, etc. are stable now, libevent has seen continued development and\u0026nbsp;been used by Facebook since quite a while and HHVM already has true asynchronous function calls, while PHP 7 is debating them at least.\r\n\r\nLazy load everything\r\n\r\nWe would\u0026nbsp;also need a more \u0022passive\u0022 bootstrap process, where things are loaded much more on demand and we go away from a pure request\/response chaining model. This is a next step into utilizing services even more.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tWhen the current user is first used somewhere (as a service), he would be authenticated automatically.\r\n\tWhen the current route is used for the first time, routing occurs.\r\n\tWhen the current session is used, the session is verified.\r\n\t...\r\n\r\n\r\nThis would allow\u0026nbsp;to skip slow and problematic parts of the bootstrap process and such easier\u0026nbsp;allow a pre-bootstrap dynamic page cache.\r\n\r\nLets start into the future of Drupal performance together!

The Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) Project which involves Google is an open source initiative that embodies the vision that publishers can create mobile optimized content once and have it load instantly everywhere. When AMP was first introduced last October 2015, many commentators immediately compared it to Facebook\u0027s Instant Articles and Apple\u0027s News app. One of the biggest differentiators between AMP and other solutions is the fact that AMP is open source.\r\n\r\nAMP is, essentially, a subset of HTML. And it really makes the web fast. AMP HTML is designed to support smart caching, predictable performance, and modern, beautiful mobile content. Since AMP HTML is built on existing web technologies, and not a template based system, publishers continue to host their own content, innovate on their user experiences, and flexibly integrate their advertising and business models -- all within a technical architecture optimized for speed and performance.\r\n\r\nIn January 2016 Lullabot and Google started working together to create the Drupal AMP module and to benefit the whole of the AMP Project. One of the most touted features of the Drupal software is its flexibility, so making Drupal produce AMP HTML has required a lot of careful consideration of the design approach. Nevertheless, the Drupal AMP module is a turnkey solution that allows publishers to easily deliver AMP content. It is also a work in progress.\r\n\r\nWhile AMP HTML is already being served by some of the biggest publishers and platforms in the world \u2014 such as The New York Times, The Economist, The Guardian, BBC, Vox Media, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and many more! \u2014 you don\u2019t have to be a large publisher to take advantage of AMP.

Why, then, do we concentrate on our users when developing a user interface, but so often forget them when developing APIs? In this talk, Christopher presents a whirlwind overview of a variety of different User Experience considerations when designing your APIs.\r\n\r\nWhy should attendees see this talk?\r\n\r\nAs developers, we\u0027re always creating APIs - whether they are libraries, a common set of functions or web services. This talk presents a relatively novel way of looking at an API - by applying UX considerations to our technical designs, and thinking of the end users, we can create better APIs that noone swears at...\r\n\r\nThis talk has been seen in 2015 at PHPUK, EndpointCon and Northeast PHP 2015, where it received 4- and 5-star ratings on\u0026nbsp;Joind.in.\r\n"},{"id":"46","title":"The Ultimate Super Duper Guide to Content Quality","date":"2016-05-11 00:00:00","room":"5","startTime":"17:00","endTime":"18:00","track":"14","experiencelevel":"beginner","desc":"This is the scene: your organization\u2019s website means well.
