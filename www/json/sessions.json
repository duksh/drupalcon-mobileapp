Deliver\u0026nbsp;it via a CDN!\r\n\r\nSpeed is asked for everywhere, every millisecond\u0026nbsp;counts, studies show that slow sites loose real money and everyone wants a fast page. But how do you get one?\r\n\r\nObviously there is a lot to optimize (time-to-first-byte on the server, Images, Javascript, CSS), but when you have optimized all of that you still have to deliver it to the user. And if your user is in Australia and your server is in the USA, this can add up to a lot of time.\r\n\r\nCDNs like Fastly solve that problem since ages for static assets (CSS, JS, Images) and with the cdn module it is a no-brainer in Drupal 7 and 8 to deliver those via any CDN. But what about the pages itself and authenticated users?\r\n\r\nDrupal 8 Cache Tags make invalidation easy\r\n\r\nThanks to the usage of Cache Tags everywhere within Drupal 8 and Fastly Surrogate Keys, it is simpler than ever to just publish content and the CDN is immediately up-to-date on all edges.\r\n\r\nThis means:\u0026nbsp;Instantaneous purging of all (and\u0026nbsp;only!) the affected pages when an article is updated. No more manual purging by content editors. No more fiddling with URLs to purge. It all just works. Optimally.\r\n\r\nCache anonymous pages without any effort. On your own reverse proxy, and on many CDNs \u2014 thanks to standardized configuration.\r\n\r\nDrupal 8 Cache Contexts make authenticated user caching possible\r\n\r\nAnd thanks to Drupal 8 Cache Contexts a simple ESI module, can make it possible to cache authenticated user content at the edge without almost any configuration needed (just a custom VCL). It transparently just works.\r\n\r\nThe typical example here is: a shopping site, users categorized in groups according to interests, and a shopping cart.\r\n\r\nAutomatic caching of the entire page, minus the shopping cart, on the edge. Reused across all users in the same group. And, if the CDN supports it, even the shopping cart can be cached on the edge (and be kept up-to-date thanks to cache tags). Otherwise\u0026nbsp;only that\u0026nbsp;needs to talk to the origin (via AJAX, for example).\r\n\r\nCache authenticated pages without any effort.\u0026nbsp; On your own reverse proxy, and on some CDNs \u2014 thanks to standardized configuration.\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n\r\nFor sites with many mobile users (high latency due to network), global audiences (high latency due to distance) and performance-sensitive sites (e-commerce), Drupal 8 will be a huge leap forward.\r\n\r\nBecause Drupal 8 has comprehensive knowledge about the cacheability of the things it renders,\u0026nbsp;that means\u0026nbsp;Drupal 8 will be able to cache\u0026nbsp;everything\u0026nbsp;at the edge!\r\n\r\nGoals\r\n\r\n\r\n\tLearn how easy it is to setup a CDN like Fastly or do-it-yourself with Varnish\r\n\tLearn about the basic caching concepts\r\n\tSee some fantastic Demos\r\n\tESI, AJAX and\u0026nbsp;hybrid rendering strategies\r\n\tGet excited about the future of the internet!\r\n\r\n\r\nAudience\r\n\r\nThe session is for everyone that is interested in having a fast site that transparently just serves everything from a CDN and hence gives the user the best possible experience.

Then, when I get home, those gorgeous cats absolutely must look fabulous on my large-screen high-resolution monitor, too.\r\n\r\nWhen there\u2019s a problem that involves cats, you can bet that Drupal is ready to help!\r\n\r\nDrupal 8 has built-in responsive images support based off of Drupal 7\u2019s contributed Picture and Breakpoint modules. Understanding how to use those modules without first making a plan could easily lead to a cat-tastrophe!\r\n\r\nSo we\u2019ll start not by reviewing every detail of the responsive images specification or every option you\u2019ll need on Drupal\u2019s configuration screen, but instead by studying cats. We\u2019ll look at how our cat photos fit into our site\u2019s layout. Once we understand that, we can plan how to create multiple versions of a cat photo. Then we can provide different size options based on the browser width and resolution. Best of all, we\u2019ll get Drupal to take care of that tedious work so we can spend more time with cats.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t worry! No cats will be harmed or cloned in this process! Even though cloning cats would create a more purr-fect world.\r\n\r\nLearning objectives and outcomes:\r\n\r\nWe want our sites to shine with beautiful images that load quickly.\r\n\r\nTo do so, we\u2019ll first learn how to analyze how a particular type of image fits into a site\u2019s layout. Then we\u2019ll use that analysis to make a plan for the image file sizes we\u2019ll need at various viewport widths.\r\n\r\nOnce we have that plan, we\u2019ll learn how to let Drupal take care of generating the image files and writing the HTML markup we\u2019ll need for our responsive images solution. That includes learning how to do that today with Drupal 7\u2019s Picture and Breakpoint modules, as well as how to do so Drupal 8, which simplifies several key steps. We\u2019ll look at responsive image configuration and image style setup, field formatter settings as well as how to work with responsive images in preprocessor functions.\r\n\r\nWhile we will discuss the key concepts of the new responsive image specification, we won\u2019t be going into great detail on the history of how these specifications were developed. Instead we\u2019ll focus on practical lessons on how to make images more responsive with Drupal, based on Marc\u2019s experience as a front-end developer at Lullabot and as one of the co-maintainers of Drupal 8\u2019s Breakpoint and Responsive Image modules.\r\n\r\nSession focus:\r\n\r\nWhat sets this session apart from others is the focus on planning out which image file sizes you will need based on your site\u0027s layout. Figuring that out is the most challenging part of working with responsive images, and this session explains how to make those decisions in a sensible way.\r\n\r\nPrevious presentation video:\r\n\r\nVideo from 2015 Twin Cities Drupal Camp presentation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"id":"143","title":"Service Workers Internals","date":"2016-05-10 00:00:00","room":"5","startTime":"17:00","endTime":"18:00","track":"9","experiencelevel":"intermediate","desc":"Rich offline experiences, periodic background syncs, push notifications\u2014 functionality that would normally require a native application\u2014are coming to the web.

When companies transact with\u0026nbsp;consumersonline, certain things are taken for granted as \u0022standard\u0022... you and I are going to pay the same price for a product, use a personal credit card to pay for it, and I will be able to specify where I want the goods shipped to.\r\n\r\nThese \u0022standards\u0022 are all turned on their head in the realm of\u0026nbsp;B2B. Different customers pay different prices for the same product, and usually pay a different unit cost based on how many they order (or even when they want it). Payment methods abound, credit card, direct debit, or generation of an invoice to be paid later. And the customer is no longer a single entity, but rather a company made up of multiple users, each with different purchase permissions. Most eCommerce platforms out there were built from the ground up to accomodate B2C use cases and process flows, and when agencies try to utilize these platforms to accomodate complex B2B client requirements, they usually find that they need to heavily customize or \u0022un-do\u0022 many of the core capabilities that are built into the platform.\r\n\r\nDrupal Commerce is different.

Drupal just started into its 8 cycle and the world is not standing still.\r\n\r\nHowever even with all the new technologies of PHP 7, dynamic page cache, BigPipe, Placeholders, etc.\u0026nbsp;Drupal 8 still has a quite\u0026nbsp;slow bootstrap phase, the internal page cache could be faster and a lot of time is wasted while waiting for I\/O (Files, Database, APC, memcache, http requests, ...) and rebuilding of caches.\r\n\r\nPHP is ready! Are you?\r\n\r\nLets explore together in this core conversation how the future of Drupal performance could look and what we need to change internally to ensure we get back on par to fast-response systems like NodeJS.\r\n\r\nOne such thing that Drupal could start doing is to start using a parallelized approach. While Drupal\u0026nbsp;is waiting, it could do other CPU intensive tasks until those are blocked again on I\/O, then get back to the original task, etc.\r\n\r\nFor this we need a kind of\u0026nbsp;event loop and a different structure within Drupal. But PHP is ready: Technologies like ReactPHP, icicle.io, etc. are stable now, libevent has seen continued development and\u0026nbsp;been used by Facebook since quite a while and HHVM already has true asynchronous function calls, while PHP 7 is debating them at least.\r\n\r\nLazy load everything\r\n\r\nWe would\u0026nbsp;also need a more \u0022passive\u0022 bootstrap process, where things are loaded much more on demand and we go away from a pure request\/response chaining model. This is a next step into utilizing services even more.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tWhen the current user is first used somewhere (as a service), he would be authenticated automatically.\r\n\tWhen the current route is used for the first time, routing occurs.\r\n\tWhen the current session is used, the session is verified.\r\n\t...\r\n\r\n\r\nThis would allow\u0026nbsp;to skip slow and problematic parts of the bootstrap process and such easier\u0026nbsp;allow a pre-bootstrap dynamic page cache.\r\n\r\nLets start into the future of Drupal performance together!

With Drupal 8 release it becomes more evident to utilize its core features and get the best output from IoT.\r\n\r\nIoT opens up a wealth of opportunities to apply technology in new and exciting ways. Our Customers are using indoor proximity technology that enables devices to perform actions when in close proximity to an iBeacon. Here are few reasons why iBeacon shines brighter than GPS or RFID:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAccuracy: Since iBeacon is a proximity technology, it is extremely accurate indoors.\r\n\tPrivacy: Because iBeacon are not tracking users everywhere they go, and rather simply logging when they come into range of an iBeacon, users can feel confident that their privacy is preserved.\r\n\tIntegration: iBeacon is a native Apple technology, so it integrates seamlessly and scales effortlessly with your Apple ecosystem. It works fine on Android systems too.\r\n\tUsability: iBeacon use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Technology, so there\u0027s very little impact to the users device and battery life\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing are some of the venues, which can be benefited using this technology:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tConferences, Exhibitions, Events\r\n\tMuseums \u0026amp; Galleries\r\n\tParks (Amusement Parks, National Parks etc.)\r\n\tRetail Stores and Shopping Malls\r\n\tHotels \u0026amp; Resorts\r\n\tRestaurants, Lounges, Clubs, Gyms\r\n\tMembership Institutions\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing are some of the features of the system:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tLocation\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tUnified seamless indoor \u0026amp; outdoor Location tracking using GPS, aGPS, Wifi, iBeacon \u0026amp; other tech\r\n\t\tProximity sensing to POIs\r\n\t\tIndoor Navigation\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tGamification\r\n\t\r\n\t\tEngage visitors in interesting games \u0026amp; activities\r\n\t\tLoyalty \u0026amp; Membership\r\n\t\tRaffle\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tAnalytics\r\n\t\r\n\t\t3Ws - When, Where, What about visitors\r\n\t\tReal time \u0026amp; Near Real time big data analytics\r\n\t\tQueue Busting\r\n\t\tAutomatic attendance \u0026amp; Registration\r\n\t\tWorkflows\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t(rich) Messaging\r\n\t\r\n\t\tEngage visitors in intuitive work-flows\r\n\t\tRich Push Notification\r\n\t\tTargeted content delivery\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this panel discussion, we will talk about:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tHow IoT and Drupal work together to deliver Digital Transformation Solutions?\r\n\tCurrent Deployment of the Product with real customers\r\n\tThe technology behind it.\r\n\tUse of iBeacon and other Sensors (Eg.

The Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) Project which involves Google is an open source initiative that embodies the vision that publishers can create mobile optimized content once and have it load instantly everywhere. When AMP was first introduced last October 2015, many commentators immediately compared it to Facebook\u0027s Instant Articles and Apple\u0027s News app. One of the biggest differentiators between AMP and other solutions is the fact that AMP is open source.\r\n\r\nAMP is, essentially, a subset of HTML. And it really makes the web fast. AMP HTML is designed to support smart caching, predictable performance, and modern, beautiful mobile content. Since AMP HTML is built on existing web technologies, and not a template based system, publishers continue to host their own content, innovate on their user experiences, and flexibly integrate their advertising and business models -- all within a technical architecture optimized for speed and performance.\r\n\r\nIn January 2016 Lullabot and Google started working together to create the Drupal AMP module and to benefit the whole of the AMP Project. One of the most touted features of the Drupal software is its flexibility, so making Drupal produce AMP HTML has required a lot of careful consideration of the design approach. Nevertheless, the Drupal AMP module is a turnkey solution that allows publishers to easily deliver AMP content. It is also a work in progress.\r\n\r\nWhile AMP HTML is already being served by some of the biggest publishers and platforms in the world \u2014 such as The New York Times, The Economist, The Guardian, BBC, Vox Media, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and many more! \u2014 you don\u2019t have to be a large publisher to take advantage of AMP.

Not only do they have to concern themselves with building and managing the form and its elements, but they also must worry about how the form is submitted and data is handled. Ten years ago, this problem was made much easier when Drupal introduced the Form API, which finally allowed developers to dynamically render their forms using PHP. This was a time when Drupal was held responsible for delivering the HTML form to the web browser interface. It was amazing and life was good.\r\n\r\nNow the web is changing and applications must be built differently. We are now in a web environment where the proliferation of devices and user interfaces has mandated a complete separation between the front-end application and the backend server. This is a time when API\u0027s are king and web applications must adapt to the new paradigm of API-first development. With this shift, we are now facing the same problems we faced before the Drupal Form API came along, but this time, we can no longer rely on Drupal to solve our form rendering problem. We need an alternative to the Form API. We need a solution that will serve as a bridge for the web applications that still need the amazing power and flexibility of Drupal, but must also leverage the latest front end technologies such as Angular.js and React.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, Travis Tidwell and Randall Knutson will talk about what is being called the \u0022Next Generation of Web Forms\u0022 where the forms themselves are dynamic JavaScript renderings of JSON based schemas. This new way of form management provides the benefits of the Form API, but also allows for the complete separation between the front-end and the back-end of the application. This capability introduces new ways to share and manipulate forms in a surprising way, and offers an elegant bridge into the world of a truly \u201cheadless\u201d Drupal.\r\n\r\nLet\u0027s talk about it!\r\n"},{"id":"39","title":"Visualizing Drupal Community through drupal.org","date":"2016-05-11 00:00:00","room":"8","startTime":"17:00","endTime":"18:00","track":"7","experiencelevel":"beginner","desc":"Drupal is one of the largest communities in the open source world today.

It does not, however, also mean you will have happy developers.\r\n\r\nDrupal 7 is notoriously hard for creating multilingual websites. Language support in D7 was bolted-on and adhoc and tends to require 20 to 30 extra modules and often a number of patches and custom workarounds as well. Drupal 7 multilingual configuration is ugly. And that\u0027s being kind.\r\n\r\nBut, Drupal has had a complete multilingual makeover! Enter Drupal 8. You might think we are talking about slapping on some makeup here, but we aren\u0027t.\r\n\r\nDefinition:\u0026nbsp;A makeover is\u0026nbsp;\u0022a complete reconstruction and renovation of something\u0022\r\n\r\nThe\u0026nbsp;Drupal 8 Multilingual Initiative\u0026nbsp;had quite a mess to untangle. The goal was to rebuild language support in Drupal from the ground up so that everything in Drupal understood language from the start. And, any custom or contributed modules or themes for Drupal 8 would reap the benefit of not really having to understand language support because it would just \u0022be there\u0022. The results are amazing.\r\n\r\nThis session is a side-by-side comparison of ugly Drupal 7 configuration and beautiful Drupal 8 configuration. What took 20+ modules in Drupal 7, takes 4 in Drupal 8, with no workarounds, patches, or hacks.\r\n\r\nWe\u0027ll compare Drupal 7 and Drupal 8 configuration for:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tLanguage support\r\n\tUser interface translation\r\n\tContent translation\r\n\tConfiguration translation\r\n\tAnd more...\r\n\r\n\r\nIntended Audience\r\n\r\nAnyone building or managing multilingual sites would benefit from this session. You will walk away with knowledge of the how Drupal 7 and Drupal 8 multilingual configuration differs so you can prepare yourself for site building in either version.\r\n\r\nSkill Levels\r\n\r\nThis session is suitable for beginners or intermediates. If you are beginner, it is best if you understand Drupal basics such as content types, blocks, menus, and views.

Those integrations can be even more successful when done in partnership with the service providers themselves. In this session, we\u0027ll explore 3 Drupal integrations that have all taken a different path to success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\tMailChimp and Mandrill: The MailChimp module started as a classic \u0022scratch your own itch\u0022 story. ThinkShout\u0027s founder Lev had a side venture built on Drupal that needed MailChimp integration, which didn\u0027t exist at the time. So he built it. It became quite popular, and too much for him to maintain on the side. So he reached out to MailChimp, which, to its everlasting credit, had the vision to invest in an open source integration, a very novel concept at the time. Since then, ThinkShout and MailChimp have partnered on the popular integration, growing its user base to over 24k installs.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tiATS Payments: The iATS integration was born out of a shared interest in serving the same group of clients, nonprofits and other mission-driven organizations. iATS Payments has long been the leading payment processor dedicated to the nonprofit community, which is ThinkShout\u2019s area of expertise. As we built websites with payment processing needs for features such as paid event registrations and donations, we heard over and over again that our clients wanted to use the iATS payment gateway, which didn\u0027t have a Drupal plugin for Drupal Commerce or Ubercart. So we reached out to iATS Payments and embarked on a partnership resulting in the Commerce iATS module, used by dozens of large nonprofits to power their commercial needs.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tSalesforce: Salesforce has emerged as the leading CRM for nonprofits, in addition to its dominance in the private sector. Its success lies, in part, on its robust API and open data policy. It\u0027s by far the easiest enterprise caliber CRM to build robust integrations with. ThinkShout built the native Drupal CRM, RedHen, as a standalone for small to midsize organizations. For larger clients, though, it just isn\u0027t enough and they require a third party CRM. For these use cases, we rewrote the Salesforce Suite to a provide a powerful bi-directional connection between any objects in the two systems, and its success speaks for itself.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nThe common thread for these integrations is to build flexible integrations than can be applied across a wide range of use cases. Having the support of the service providers is a huge bonus, but not required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"id":"17","title":"Creating online stores with Commerce 2.x on Drupal 8","date":"2016-05-12 00:00:00","room":"11","startTime":"10:45","endTime":"11:45","track":"3","experiencelevel":"intermediate","desc":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this session you will learn about the history, architecture, and features of Drupal Commerce 2.x on Drupal 8.\r\n\r\nCommerce 2.x development began with a code sprint in\u0026nbsp;July 2014. We first released a handful of standalone PHP libraries (e.g. for currency formatting and addressing)\u0026nbsp;and then created modules that make use of them, such as the new\u0026nbsp;Address module.

However the proposed Agile estimation techniques uses story points, team velocity, planning poker and all such stuff focusing more on rituals whilst placing not nearly enough on value.\r\n\r\n#NoEstimate is a recent kid on the block ( introduced around 2012-13 ) that tries to solve this ubiquitous problem via eliminating the problem itself i.e. doing away with estimates. The idea is to find the right granularity for your Product Backlog Items ( PBIs ) \u0026nbsp;and avoiding the need to differentiate between Small\/ Medium\/ Large\/ Extra Large or 2,3,5,8,13 sizing of the PBIs.

The main take-away is how the idea of prototyping and shifting our workflows can ultimately speed up the entire development cycle.\r\n\r\nIn this session you will learn:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe principles of collaborative design methodology\r\n\tHow to create a design workflow suited for the tools you are already using\r\n\tHow to incorporate Drupal 8\u2019s theming tools into your design workflow\r\n\tHow to sell prototyping to clients, project managers, and other stakeholders\r\n\r\n"},{"id":"86","title":"(Sales + PM) x productive collaboration = happy team + happy client","date":"2016-05-12 00:00:00","room":"5","startTime":"14:15","endTime":"15:15","track":"11","experiencelevel":"intermediate","desc":"How can the sales and the project management departments of an agency have a healthy and friendly relationship while maintaining good client service and setting correct expectations throughout?\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n\r\nEvery agency has some kind of tension between the project management office and the sales team. \u0026nbsp;This tension should not go away, and it\u2019s possible to have healthy relationship where both teams understand each other\u2019s priorities and work together to serve the client as seamless and surprise-less of an experience as possible. \u0026nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe presentation will be a joint presentation between a seasoned veteran of project management, Ashleigh Thevenet, and of business development, Kyle Theobald. \u0026nbsp;It will not only touch on the problem as a whole in a light-hearted way, but also discuss tools and processes that can be used to smooth out the interaction between the departments and make sure the client gets optimum service.\r\n\r\nSome of the questions that will be answered during the talk:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tWhy this subject is likely the number one reason agencies fail or succeed to thrive?\r\n\t\r\n\tWhat are some of the tensions that exist and where do they come from?\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tWhat are the priorities of each department and how does that lend to the problems we see?\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tHow does the handling of intracompany communications affect the outcome for the client?\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tWhat are the tools and approaches that make this better for everyone?\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nAshleigh\u2019s speaking xp:\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.drupal.org\/u\/ashleigh-thevenet\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\tHow Changing our Estimation Process Took our Project Endgame from WTF to FTW!

So what would intention-revealing, expressive PHP code look like without using for() and foreach()? Let\u0027s explore some functional programming concepts and find out! Knowing basic functional programming concepts will improve your PHP code. Your new mindset will favor writing code with better separation of concerns and decreased complexity: clean code. We will explore some poor examples of using loops to process data, then ease into learning functional concepts like map, reduce, filter and collection pipelining.
